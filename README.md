# HACC

C# DotNet 6 HTML ANSI Console Canvas.
* Contains a virtual terminal character buffer with text and appearance kept separately.
* Contains a HTML component that renders the character buffer contents.
* Contains glue code to create a System.Console compatible ANSI Console on an HTML5 Canvas.

## Work in progress.

Will update readme once alpha is attained.

## Tests
- https://github.com/JessicaMulein/HACC.Tests

## Development
* At the moment the HACC and HACC.Tests repos are nested onto a private repo with another game I am developing and I use that project to run the tests and keep the two repos in step.
* I will need to create a HACC.Solution repo or something to contain them for any developers that wish to assist, or that can be your first project.
* Would love a collaborator on this and other projects.

## Future
* https://github.com/JessicaMulein/PlayZMachine will be based on this
* A possible BBS with door games like ZMachine and the private repo I mentioned (top secret!).
